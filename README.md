# My 12-Week Differentiator Data Science Journey

Welcome to my **12-Week Data Science Journey** repository! üöÄ

This repo contains **all the projects, codes, and learnings** I build step-by-step as I progress from beginner to advanced data scientist.  
Each week focuses on different practical skills, real-world datasets, and industry-relevant techniques.

---

## Why This Journey?

The data science field is competitive.  
I designed this 12-week roadmap to go beyond theory and build meaningful projects that:

- Solve real-world problems  
- Use best practices and modular, clean code  
- Cover all key topics from data cleaning to deep learning and deployment  
- Showcase my skills on GitHub to impress recruiters and peers
