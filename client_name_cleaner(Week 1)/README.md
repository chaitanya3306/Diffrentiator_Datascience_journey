# Client Name Cleaner Tool

A beginner-friendly real-world mini project to **clean messy customer name data** using Python and Pandas. This is Week 1 of my journey to becoming a top-tier data scientist. ðŸ’¼

## Problem Statement

Companies often collect customer names through online forms or CRMs. These names are usually:
- Written in **all caps** or **all lowercase**
- Have **extra spaces**, symbols, or invalid entries like numbers
- Sometimes **blank or missing**

> Your job is to clean and standardize this raw data for analytics, dashboards, or database ingestion.

## What This Tool Does

- Reads raw customer names from a CSV  
- Removes blank or invalid names  
- Strips extra spaces  
- Converts names to Title Case  
- Outputs a clean CSV for further use
